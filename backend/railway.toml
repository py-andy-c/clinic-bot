# Railway Config as Code
# This file configures the build and deployment for Railway
# See: https://docs.railway.com/guides/config-as-code
# Configuration defined here overrides dashboard settings

[build]
# Use Railpack (default) - Railway's modern buildpack
# Railway will auto-detect dependencies from requirements.txt
builder = "RAILPACK"

# Specify Python version via nixpacksPlan (Railpack respects this)
# This replaces runtime.txt for Python version specification
[build.nixpacksPlan]
[build.nixpacksPlan.phases]
[build.nixpacksPlan.phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python312"]

[deploy]
# Start command - runs migrations and starts the app via start.sh
# start.sh handles: alembic directory fix, migrations, and app startup
startCommand = "bash start.sh"

# Health check configuration
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 180  # Increased to 3 minutes to allow for migrations and startup

# Restart policy - restart on failure
restartPolicyType = "ALWAYS"

# NOTE: WeasyPrint requires apt packages to be installed via environment variables
# Set these in Railway dashboard (Variables section):
#   RAILPACK_BUILD_APT_PACKAGES = libglib2.0-0 libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0
#   RAILPACK_DEPLOY_APT_PACKAGES = libglib2.0-0 libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0
# These cannot be set in railway.toml - they must be set in the Railway dashboard
