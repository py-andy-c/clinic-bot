• personnel — HR/finance about employees, compensation, benefits, and attendance. Sample tables: employee (employment_status, pay_type, flsa_status, base_salary_amount), department (department_name), job (job_title, job_level), location (country_code), date (date), payroll (hours_overtime, base_pay_amount, bonus_amount, employer_benefit_cost_amount), benefits_enrollment (benefit_type, coverage_tier, employer_premium_amount).
