# Calendar Implementation Migration: From React Big Calendar to Mock UI Design

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for migrating the clinic calendar from its current React Big Calendar-based implementation to match the production-ready mock UI design. The mock UI demonstrates superior user experience with unified sticky grid architecture, compact space-efficient design, and better mobile optimization.

**Goal:** Achieve pixel-perfect visual fidelity with the mock UI while preserving all existing production functionality including modals, state management, caching, and backend integration.

**🚀 PHASE 3 COMPLETED:** Advanced features implemented (modal integration, current time indicator, performance optimizations) with event interaction handlers, caching system, and comprehensive modal framework.

## Key Migration Decisions

### Features NOT Being Ported

Based on analysis of the mock UI design and current implementation, the following features will **not** be migrated:

#### 1. Touch/Swipe Gestures for Mobile Navigation
**Decision:** Remove swipe navigation entirely
**Rationale:**
- Mock UI relies exclusively on click-based navigation (buttons + mini calendar modal)
- Wide side-by-side practitioner view in daily view would conflict with horizontal swiping
- Horizontal swiping reserved for navigating between practitioners instead of dates
- Simplifies implementation and removes gesture complexity

#### 2. Column Width Synchronization in Week View
**Decision:** Remove complex synchronization logic
**Rationale:**
- Mock UI uses simple flex layout (`flex: 1`) with `min-width` properties
- CSS automatically handles column width alignment between headers and body
- Eliminates 100+ lines of complex ResizeObserver synchronization code
- Better performance and maintainability

#### 3. Auto-scroll to 9AM Functionality
**Decision:** Fix mock UI "bug" - always scroll to current time instead of 9AM
**Rationale:**
- Mock UI has inconsistent behavior: scrolls to 9AM on load but current time on "today" button
- Current time scrolling is more user-friendly and practical
- Aligns with modern calendar applications that show current context
- Fixes the identified inconsistency in mock UI implementation

### Features Being Enhanced During Migration

#### Current Time Indicator & Auto-scroll
- **Implementation:** Scroll to current time on initial load AND when navigating to today
- **Enhancement:** Fix mock UI inconsistency by using current time consistently
- **Benefit:** Users see relevant current time context instead of arbitrary 9AM position

## Layout Constraints & Resolution

### ClinicLayout Constraints Analysis

The current ClinicLayout applies standard page layout constraints that prevent the calendar from achieving the mock UI's compact, edge-to-edge design:

```jsx
// Current ClinicLayout structure
<main className="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-2 md:py-6 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
  <div className="px-4 py-2 md:py-6 sm:px-0 md:max-w-4xl md:mx-auto">
    {children} {/* Calendar content constrained here */}
  </div>
</main>
```

**Layout Issues:**
- **Width Constraints**: `max-w-7xl` (1280px) → `max-w-4xl` (896px) on desktop
- **Centering**: `mx-auto` centers content instead of full-width utilization
- **Padding Layers**: Multiple padding layers prevent edge-to-edge layout
- **Header Gap**: 24-48px gap between header and calendar content
- **Not Compact**: Calendar doesn't "touch the header directly and the left/right" as intended

### Chosen Solution: Calendar-Specific Layout Override

**Recommendation:** Implement a `CalendarLayout` wrapper component that overrides ClinicLayout constraints while preserving the shared header infrastructure.

**Why This Approach:**
- **Isolated Change**: Only affects calendar page, no risk to other clinic pages
- **Clean Implementation**: Proper React component, not CSS hacks
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Minimal Risk**: No changes to shared ClinicLayout component
- **Future-Proof**: Can be extended if other pages need full-width layout

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **CalendarLayout Component**: Wraps calendar content to override ClinicLayout padding
2. **Full-Width Reset**: Uses negative margins to counteract centering and max-width constraints
3. **Header Integration**: Positions calendar directly below 64px ClinicLayout header
4. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintains all header navigation, user menu, and mobile behaviors

---

## Color Assignment Strategy

### Extended Color Palette for 10 Practitioners + 10 Resources

**Color Palette:** Extended 20-color palette to support separate limits for practitioners and resources
```typescript
// Extended palette: 10 primary + 10 secondary colors
const CALENDAR_COLORS = [
  // Primary set (practitioners - first 10)
  '#3b82f6', '#10b981', '#f59e0b', '#ef4444', '#8b5cf6',
  '#ec4899', '#06b6d4', '#84cc16', '#f97316', '#6366f1',
  // Secondary set (resources - next 10)
  '#7c3aed', '#be123c', '#ea580c', '#65a30d', '#0891b2',
  '#c2410c', '#7c2d12', '#365314', '#1e3a8a', '#581c87'
];
```

### Assignment Logic with Deselection/Reselection Handling

**Strategy:** Priority-based assignment with color persistence for better UX
```typescript
function assignCalendarColors(
  selectedPractitioners: number[],
  selectedResources: number[]
): Map<string, string> {
  const colors = new Map<string, string>();

  // Priority 1: Assign to practitioners (first 10 colors)
  selectedPractitioners.slice(0, 10).forEach((id, index) => {
    colors.set(`practitioner-${id}`, CALENDAR_COLORS[index]);
  });

  // Priority 2: Assign to resources (next 10 colors)
  selectedResources.slice(0, 10).forEach((id, index) => {
    const colorIndex = 10 + index; // Colors 10-19
    colors.set(`resource-${id}`, CALENDAR_COLORS[colorIndex]);
  });

  return colors;
}
```

### Deselection/Reselection Behavior

**Color Persistence:** When items are deselected and reselected, they maintain their assigned colors
- **Practitioners:** Always get colors 0-9 based on selection order
- **Resources:** Always get colors 10-19 based on selection order
- **Benefit:** Users get consistent visual feedback - same practitioner/resource always appears in the same color

**Example:**
1. Select Practitioner A → Gets color #3b82f6 (index 0)
2. Deselect Practitioner A
3. Select Practitioner B → Gets color #3b82f6 (index 0, now assigned to B)
4. Reselect Practitioner A → Gets next available color #10b981 (index 1)

**Why This Approach:**
- **Predictable:** Same item types get same color ranges
- **Scalable:** Supports 10 practitioners + 10 resources = 20 total
- **User-Friendly:** Color consistency for frequently used items
- **Simple:** No complex persistence logic required

## Migration Approach: React Grid Hybrid

### Chosen Strategy

**Implementation:** Replace React Big Calendar's grid rendering system with a custom React implementation that exactly matches the mock UI's unified sticky grid architecture, while preserving all existing React state management, modal functionality, and backend integration.

**Why This Approach:**
- Achieves pixel-perfect visual fidelity with the mock UI design
- Preserves all existing production functionality without regression
- Maintains React ecosystem benefits (TypeScript, testing, debugging)
- Enables moderate technical debt cleanup without complete rewrite
- Provides future-proof foundation for enhancements

### Technical Architecture

```
New Calendar Architecture:
ClinicLayout (preserved - global header)
└── CalendarLayout (new - overrides padding for full-width)
    └── AvailabilityPage (existing state management)
        ├── CalendarSidebar (new - replaces selector dropdown)
        │   ├── ViewSwitcher component
        │   ├── PractitionerFilter checkboxes
        │   └── ResourceFilter checkboxes
        ├── CalendarDateStrip (new - replaces toolbar)
        │   ├── Navigation arrows
        │   ├── Date display with mini calendar trigger
        │   └── Action buttons (+預約, +休診, 今, settings)
        ├── CalendarGrid (new - replaces React Big Calendar)
        │   ├── StickyHeader (time + resource headers)
        │   ├── TimeColumn (28px sticky left)
        │   └── ResourceColumns[] (flex layout)
        │       └── TimeSlots + Events (overlapping logic)
        ├── Modals (all existing - preserved)
        └── Inline action buttons (replaces FAB)
```

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. Grid Implementation
- **Custom CSS Grid:** Use CSS Grid for month view, Flexbox for time-based views
- **Sticky Positioning:** CSS `position: sticky` for headers and time column
- **Event Overlapping:** Port mock's overlapping logic to React components
- **Auto-scaling Columns:** Simple flex layout eliminates complex width synchronization
- **Performance:** React.memo, useMemo, and virtual scrolling for large datasets

#### 2. State Management Preservation
- **Maintain Existing:** Keep all current Redux/Zustand state and localStorage persistence
- **Add Grid State:** New state for grid-specific features (scroll position, time indicator)
- **Unified Updates:** Single source of truth for calendar data

#### 3. Modal System Integration
- **Preserve All Modals:** All 17 existing modal components remain unchanged
- **Event Triggers:** Calendar events trigger existing modal workflows
- **State Sync:** Modal content updates when calendar data refreshes

#### 4. API & Caching Integration
- **Preserve Caching:** Maintain existing 5-minute TTL cache with batch endpoints
- **Request Deduplication:** Keep in-flight request prevention logic
- **Error Handling:** Maintain 404 graceful handling for clinic switches
