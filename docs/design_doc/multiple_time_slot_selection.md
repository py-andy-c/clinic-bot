# Multiple Time Slot Selection - Business Logic & Technical Design

## Overview

This document defines the business logic and technical design for multiple time slot selection in appointments. Patients can select multiple preferred time slots during booking, and clinics can review and confirm the final appointment time from these preferences.

Similar to practitioner auto-assignment, the system creates appointments with temporary slots that auto-confirm at the recency limit (`minimum_booking_hours_ahead` hours before appointment) or can be manually confirmed by clinic staff.

---

## Key Business Logic

### 1. Multiple Time Slot Selection Core Rules

**Core Rule**: When `allow_multiple_time_slot_selection = True` on an appointment type, patients select multiple preferred time slots instead of a single specific time.

- **Patient Perspective**: Patients see and select multiple available time slots (e.g., "I prefer 10:00, 14:00, or 16:00")
- **Clinic Perspective**: Clinic sees the patient's preferences and can choose the best slot
- **Appointment State**: Appointment is created with a temporary slot from the selection, marked as `pending_time_confirmation = TRUE`
- **Time Display**: Shows "待安排" (to be arranged) until clinic confirms the final time

**Rationale**: Allows flexibility for both patients (more booking options) and clinics (better scheduling control).

### 2. Appointment Creation with Multiple Slots

**Core Rule**: Appointments with multiple time slot selection are created with a temporary slot and require clinic confirmation.

#### Patient Booking Process
When `allow_multiple_time_slot_selection = True`:
1. Patient selects appointment type → selects practitioner (if allowed) → selects multiple time slots → confirms
2. System creates appointment with one slot from selection (any slot works - just to hold the time)
3. Appointment is marked as `pending_time_confirmation = True`
4. All selected slots are stored as `alternative_time_slots` (JSON array)
5. Patient receives confirmation showing "待安排" for time, no ICS calendar event generated

#### Clinic Review Process
1. Appointment appears in pending review appointments page
2. Clinic sees current temporary slot + all alternative slots
3. Clinic can confirm current slot or change to different slot from alternatives
4. Once confirmed, patient receives LINE notification with final time
5. ICS calendar event is generated and sent to patient/practitioner

**Rationale**: Similar to practitioner auto-assignment - gives clinic control while allowing patient flexibility.

### 3. Permission and Access Rules

**Core Rule**: Pending time confirmation appointments follow similar permission rules to auto-assigned appointments.

#### Clinic User Access
- **Admin Users**: Can view and confirm all pending time confirmation appointments
- **Practitioner Users**: Can view and confirm pending appointments where they are the assigned practitioner
- **Non-admin practitioners**: Get access to pending review appointments page (currently admin-only)

#### Patient Access
- Can view appointment with "待安排" time in their appointment list
- Can edit/delete appointment until clinic confirms time (following current appointment edit/delete rules)
- When editing, patient cannot re-select multiple slots (simplified to single slot selection to avoid complexity)
- Cannot reschedule once time is confirmed

**Rationale**: Maintains clinic control over scheduling while giving appropriate staff access.

### 4. Confirmation and Notification Rules

**Core Rule**: Appointments auto-confirm at the same timing as practitioner auto-assignment (`minimum_booking_hours_ahead` hours before appointment).

#### Before Confirmation
- **Patient**: Receives confirmation with "待安排" time, no calendar event
- **Practitioner**: No notification sent (appointment not visible on calendar)
- **Clinic**: Receives pending review notification (similar to auto-assignment)

#### Auto-Confirmation Timing
- **Same as Practitioner Auto-Assignment**: Uses `minimum_booking_hours_ahead` hours before appointment
- **Automatic Selection**: System automatically selects the earliest chronologically available slot from patient's preferences
- **Cascading Fallback**: If earliest slot is unavailable, tries next earliest slot, continuing until successful
- **Clinic Override**: Clinics can select any available time slot (not limited to patient preferences) for maximum scheduling flexibility

#### After Confirmation (Manual or Auto)
- **Patient**: Receives LINE notification with confirmed time, ICS calendar event generated
- **Practitioner**: Receives standard appointment notification after confirmation (same as single-slot appointments), appointment appears on calendar
- **Clinic**: Standard confirmation notification

**Rationale**: Prevents premature notifications and calendar conflicts, provides consistent timing with existing auto-assignment system.

### 5. Edge Cases and Constraints

**Core Rule**: Multiple time slot selection appointments follow existing appointment constraints with additional rules.

#### Booking Restrictions
- All existing booking restrictions apply (minimum hours ahead, max booking window, etc.)
- Each selected slot must individually pass booking restrictions
- If any slots fail validation, booking is blocked with error message listing problematic slots
- System validates all selected slots before allowing booking submission

#### Practitioner Assignment
- If practitioner specified: Only that practitioner and admins can review/confirm
- If practitioner not specified (auto-assigned): Any clinic user can review/confirm
- Practitioner changes follow existing auto-assignment rules

#### Cancellation and Modification
- Patients can cancel/modify appointment until time is confirmed
- After confirmation, normal appointment rules apply
- Clinic can always modify time during review process

**Rationale**: Ensures consistency with existing appointment system while adding new functionality.

## Backend Technical Design

### API Endpoints

#### `POST /liff/appointments` (Enhanced)
- **Enhancement**: Support `selected_time_slots` array when `allow_multiple_time_slot_selection = True`
- **New Request Fields**:
  - `selected_time_slots?: string[]` - Array of ISO datetime strings for preferred slots
  - `allow_multiple_time_slot_selection?: boolean` - Whether appointment type supports multiple slots
- **Logic**: If `selected_time_slots` provided, create appointment with temporary slot and store alternatives
- **Validation**: Ensure all selected slots are valid and available

#### `GET /clinic/pending-review-appointments` (Enhanced)
- **Enhancement**: Include appointments with `pending_time_confirmation = True`
- **Response Enhancement**: Add `alternative_time_slots` field to show patient's preferences
- **New Response Fields**:
  - `alternative_time_slots: string[]` - Array of preferred time slots
  - `pending_time_confirmation: boolean` - Whether appointment awaits time confirmation

#### Enhanced `PUT /clinic/appointments/{appointment_id}`
- **Description**: Update appointment (existing endpoint, enhanced for time confirmation)
- **New Request Field**: `confirm_time_selection?: boolean` - Flag to indicate this is a time confirmation for pending multiple slot appointment
- **Validation**: When `confirm_time_selection=true`, confirmed time must be in `alternative_time_slots` or current slot
- **Side Effects**: When `confirm_time_selection=true`, sends notifications, generates ICS calendar event, sets `pending_time_confirmation=false`

#### Auto-Confirmation Background Service
- **Description**: Automatically confirms time slots at booking-time `minimum_booking_hours_ahead` hours before appointment
- **Schedule**: Runs every hour (same as practitioner auto-assignment)
- **Logic**: Finds `pending_time_confirmation=true` appointments within recency limit, auto-selects earliest chronologically available slot from patient's alternatives
- **Fallback**: If no alternative slots are available, marks appointment for manual clinic confirmation and sends admin notification
- **Notifications**: Same notification templates used for both auto and manual confirmation (no differentiation needed)

### Database Schema

#### Appointments Table (Enhancements)
**New Fields**:
```sql
pending_time_confirmation BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
alternative_time_slots JSONB NULL  -- Array of ISO datetime strings in ascending chronological order
confirmed_by_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NULL
confirmed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL
```

**Constraints**:
- `alternative_time_slots` can only be set when `pending_time_confirmation = TRUE`
- `confirmed_by_user_id` and `confirmed_at` set when time is confirmed (NULL for auto-confirmations)
- `pending_time_confirmation` set to FALSE after confirmation
- Maximum 10 slots allowed in `alternative_time_slots` array (enforced at API level)

#### Migration Strategy
- Add new columns with default values
- Update existing appointments: `pending_time_confirmation = FALSE`
- Backfill `alternative_time_slots = NULL` for existing appointments

### Business Logic Implementation

#### AppointmentService Enhancements
**New Methods**:
- `create_multiple_slot_appointment()`: Creates appointment with multiple time preferences
- `confirm_appointment_time()`: Confirms final time slot and triggers notifications
- `validate_multiple_slots()`: Validates selected time slots are available and valid

**Enhanced Methods**:
- `create_appointment()`: Support `selected_time_slots` parameter
- `get_pending_review_appointments()`: Include time confirmation pending appointments

#### Key Business Logic
- **Initial Slot Selection**: Randomly pick one slot from `selected_time_slots` for initial appointment creation (no preference ordering assumed)
- **Auto-Confirmation Selection**: Select earliest chronologically available slot from patient's preferences (assumes patients select slots in rough preference order)
- **Availability Check**: Validate all selected slots are available at booking time
- **Permission Check**: For time confirmation, check if user can access the appointment
- **Auto-Confirmation**: Background service automatically confirms time at `minimum_booking_hours_ahead` hours before appointment
- **Notification Trigger**: After time confirmation, send standard appointment notifications
- **Calendar Integration**: Generate ICS events only after time confirmation
- **Fallback Logic**: If auto-confirmation fails, appointment remains pending for manual confirmation with clinic notification

### User Interaction Flows

#### Flow 1: Patient Booking with Multiple Slots (LIFF)
1. **Appointment Type Selection**: Patient sees appointment types with subtle "可選多時段" badge for types supporting multiple slots
2. **Date Selection**: Standard calendar picker, dates with available slots are clickable
3. **Time Slot Selection**: Instead of radio buttons, screen shows checkbox grid of available times (e.g., "□ 09:00 □ 10:00 □ 14:00 □ 15:00")
4. **Slot Counter & Management**: Top of screen shows "已選擇 3/10 個時段" with selected slots displayed as removable chips below ("14:00 ✕, 15:00 ✕, 16:00 ✕")
5. **Validation**: "繼續" button disabled until at least 1 slot selected, error message if >10 slots attempted
6. **Confirmation Screen**: Shows "預約時間: 待安排" instead of specific time, lists all selected preferences
7. **Post-Booking**: Confirmation message states "您的預約已建立，將於稍後確認時間"

#### Flow 2: Clinic Review and Confirmation
1. **Pending Appointments List**: Appointments show orange "待安排" badge next to time, small "多時段" pill indicator
2. **Auto-Confirmation Timer**: Each card shows countdown "將於 2 小時 30 分鐘後自動確認" in amber text (matching practitioner auto-assignment styling)
3. **Alternative Slots Preview**: Below the main appointment info, collapsible section shows "患者偏好時段 (3 個選項)" with expand arrow
4. **Expanded Alternative View**: Clicking expands to show:
   - Current slot: "目前使用: 今日 14:00" (grayed background)
   - Patient preferences as bullet list: "• 今日 15:00 • 今日 16:00 • 明日 09:00"
   - Radio buttons next to each alternative for selection
5. **Date Time Picker Integration**: If clinic opens full date time picker, patient's alternative slots are marked with teal borders and "患者偏好" badges
6. **Manual Confirmation**: Select radio button for desired slot → "確認此時段" button appears → click to confirm
7. **Quick Actions**: "使用目前時段" button always available to confirm current slot without expanding
8. **Success Feedback**: Green success toast "已確認預約時間 今日 15:00", appointment card disappears from pending list

#### Flow 3: Patient Views Pending Appointment (LIFF)
1. **Appointment List**: Shows "預約時間: 待安排" with orange pending indicator
2. **Appointment Card**: Tapping shows standard appointment details but time field shows "待安排 (將於稍後確認)"
3. **Edit Restrictions**: "改期" button disabled with tooltip "時間確認前無法修改"
4. **Status Updates**: After clinic confirmation, time field updates to confirmed time with green checkmark

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] **All Slots Become Unavailable**: Temporary slot becomes unavailable during review
  - Solution: Allow clinic to choose alternative or contact patient

- [ ] **Patient Cancels Before Confirmation**: Patient cancels appointment while pending
  - Solution: Remove from pending review, send cancellation notifications

- [ ] **Clinic Changes Practitioner**: During time confirmation, clinic changes practitioner
  - Solution: Follow existing practitioner reassignment rules

- [ ] **Concurrent Confirmations**: Multiple clinic users try to confirm same appointment
  - Solution: Backend optimistic locking, show conflict error

- [ ] **Time Slot Conflicts**: Selected slots conflict with other appointments during booking
  - Solution: Re-validate availability before booking, show error if conflicts

- [ ] **Slots Become Unavailable During Booking**: Patient selects slots but they become unavailable before completing booking
  - Solution: Validate all slots again at booking submission, redirect to time selection if any unavailable

- [ ] **Maximum Slots**: Patient tries to book with more than 10 slots
  - Solution: Frontend validation limits to 10 slots, backend validation, clear error messages

- [ ] **Unavailable Alternative Slots**: Some of patient's preferred slots become unavailable before clinic review
  - Solution: Mark unavailable slots with red X and "時段已預約" text, disable radio buttons, show warning if no alternatives remain

- [ ] **Multiple Earliest Slots**: During auto-confirmation, multiple alternative slots have the same earliest time
  - Solution: Select the first slot in the stored array order (maintains predictability)

- [ ] **Auto-Confirmation Race Condition**: Selected slot becomes unavailable between availability check and confirmation attempt
  - Solution: Try next earliest available slot, continue until successful or mark for manual confirmation

#### Error Scenarios
- [ ] **Slot Selection API Failure**: Cannot load available slots
  - User Message: "無法載入可用時段，請稍後再試"
  - Recovery: Retry option, fallback to single slot selection

- [ ] **Booking Validation Failure**: Selected slots no longer available
  - User Message: "部分時段已被預約，請重新選擇"
  - Recovery: Return to time selection step

- [ ] **Time Confirmation Failure**: Cannot confirm selected time slot
  - User Message: "確認時間失敗，可能時段已被預約"
  - Recovery: Refresh available slots, try different slot

### Testing Requirements

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- [ ] **Multiple Slot Booking Flow**: Patient selects multiple slots, books appointment
  - Steps: Navigate to booking → select multiple-slot appointment type → pick date → check multiple time slots → verify slot counter and chips → confirm booking
  - Assertions: Appointment created with "待安排" time, slot chips display correctly, pending review shows appointment

- [ ] **Clinic Time Confirmation Flow**: Clinic confirms time from alternatives
  - Steps: Open pending review → click appointment with "待安排" badge → expand alternative slots → select different slot → confirm → verify success message
  - Assertions: Patient receives LINE notification, appointment moves to confirmed status, time displays correctly

- [ ] **Alternative Slots in Date Time Picker**: Alternative slots are marked in picker
  - Steps: Open pending appointment → click to open full date time picker → verify patient's alternative slots show teal borders and "患者偏好" badges
  - Assertions: Alternative slots visually distinguished from regular available slots, tooltips show preference explanation, selection still works normally

- [ ] **Patient Views Pending Appointment**: Patient sees pending appointment details
  - Steps: View appointment list → verify "待安排" time display → attempt edit (should be disabled) → wait for confirmation → verify time updates
  - Assertions: Pending state shows correctly, edit restrictions work, confirmed state displays properly

#### Integration Tests (MSW)
- [ ] **Multiple Slot Selection**: Time slot selector with multiple selection
  - Mock: Available slots API returns time grid
  - Interactions: Click checkboxes to select slots → verify counter updates → remove slots via chips → submit booking
  - Assertions: Selected slots stored in state, UI shows correct count and chips, max 10 slots enforced

- [ ] **Pending Review Display**: Alternative slots display in pending review
  - Mock: Pending appointments API with current slot + 3 alternatives (some available, some unavailable)
  - Interactions: Verify collapsed state shows count → click to expand → verify current slot highlighted → select alternative slot → click confirm → verify loading state and success message
  - Assertions: Collapsed by default shows "患者偏好時段 (3)", expanded shows radio list with current slot marked, unavailable slots show red X, confirmation triggers API call with correct slot ID

#### Unit Tests
- [ ] **MultipleTimeSlotSelector**: Slot selection logic, validation
- [ ] **useConfirmAppointmentTime**: Mutation hook error handling
- [ ] **Service**: Auto-confirmation service
  - Test cases: Auto-confirmation timing, slot selection logic, fallback handling
- [ ] **Appointment validation**: Multiple slot validation logic

### UI/UX Design Patterns

#### Visual Design
- **Color Coding**: Orange/amber for pending states ("待安排"), green for confirmed states
- **Badges & Indicators**: Small badges to distinguish multiple-slot appointments ("多時段") and pending status
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Alternative slots collapsed by default to reduce clutter
- **Consistent Spacing**: Match existing appointment card layouts and spacing patterns

#### Alternative Slots Display Strategy
- **Compact View**: Collapsed state shows "患者偏好時段 (X)" with expand arrow
- **Expanded View**: Radio button list with current slot highlighted and alternatives selectable
- **Date Time Picker Integration**: Alternative slots marked with teal borders and "患者偏好" badges when picker opens from pending appointment context

#### Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Alternative text for checkboxes, proper ARIA labels for expandable sections
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order through time slots, Enter/Space to select, arrow keys in expanded lists
- **Color Independence**: Don't rely solely on color to convey state (use icons + text)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile, adequate spacing between interactive elements

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Time Slot Grid**: 3-4 columns on mobile, more on tablet/desktop
- **Selected Slots Chips**: Horizontal scroll on small screens, wrap on larger screens
- **Modal Sizing**: Full-screen on mobile, centered modal on desktop for time confirmation

### Performance Considerations

- [ ] **Slot Availability Loading**: Cache availability data per date range
- [ ] **Pending Review Rendering**: Efficiently display alternative slots without excessive re-renders
- [ ] **API Optimization**: Batch validate multiple slots in single request
- [ ] **State Updates**: Minimize re-renders when selecting/deselecting slots
