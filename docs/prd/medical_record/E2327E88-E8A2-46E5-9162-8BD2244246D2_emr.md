# AI-Native EMR Transformation Proposal

**UUID:** E2327E88-E8A2-46E5-9162-8BD2244246D2\
**Date:** February 1, 2026\
**Target Market:** Taiwan Clinics (Small to Medium Enterprise)

## 1. Executive Summary

Transforming the current platform into a comprehensive, AI-native Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system is a high-value strategic pivot. By leveraging existing assets (Patient Profile, Line Integration, Appointment System), we can build a differentiated product that solves the core pain points of Taiwanese clinics: administrative burden, fragmented data, and outdated software.

This proposal outlines a phased approach, minimizing risk while steadily moving towards the "Big Dream" of an invisible, AI-powered documentation assistant.

## 2. Market Analysis: Taiwan Healthcare Context

The Taiwanese EMR market is mature but fragmented.

* **High Adoption, Low Interoperability:** While >90% of hospitals have EMRs (driven by National Health Insurance claims), small clinics often use legacy, on-premise software that is clunky and disconnected.
* **Regulatory Trends:** The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) is pushing for FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards. Security and encryption are paramount (ISO standards).
* **The Opportunity:**
  * **Modern UX:** Most incumbent systems look like Windows 95 apps. A modern, web-based, mobile-responsive design is a massive differentiator.
  * **Line Dominance:** Line is the operating system of daily life in Taiwan. Deep integration here is our "moat" against international competitors who don't understand the local ecosystem.
  * **AI Readiness:** Clinics are drowning in paperwork. An AI that "just writes the notes" is the killer feature.

## 3. The Vision: AI-Native & Invisible

The ultimate goal is an EMR that *disappears*.

* **Input:** Natural conversation (recording), photos (x-rays, extensive range of motion), and chat logs (Line).
* **Process:** AI listens, transcribes, structures, and files the data.
* **Output:** A pristine, insurance-compliant medical record, ready for the doctor to review and sign.

## 4. Technical Feasibility Study

### 4.1. Line Integration

* **Status:** We already have basics.
* **Capabilities:**
  * **Messaging API:** Can send appointment reminders, post-visit care instructions, and follow-ups.
  * **User Input:** Patients can send photos (skin conditions, previous reports) directly to the official account.
  * **Limitations:** File size limits exist (images < 10MB, video < 200MB). We must offload storage to our cloud (AWS S3/GCS) immediately and not rely on Line for retention (Line deletes files after a short period).
  * **LIFF (Line Front-end Framework):** We can embed our "Patient Portal" directly inside Line, removing the need for patients to install a separate app.

### 4.2. Web App vs. Native App (The "Recording" Challenge)

The "Big Dream" requires recording a session while the phone is in a pocket (screen off/backgrounded).

* **Web App (Current):**
  * *Pros:* Easy deployment, cross-platform (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile).
  * *Cons (Critical):* **Background Audio Recording is severely limited**, especially on iOS (iPhones). If the screen locks, the recording often stops. The Wake Lock API can keep the screen *on*, but this drains battery and causes accidental touches in a pocket.
* **Native App (Required for Phase 3):**
  * *Pros:* Full access to background audio services, robust notification management, offline capabilities.
  * *Cons:* Higher development effort (App Store approval, separate codebase).
* **Recommendation:**
  * **Short Term:** Build a robust **Web App** optimized for Desktop/Tablet (common in clinic exam rooms).
  * **Long Term:** For the "Phone in Pocket" AI Scribe, we will likely need a **Companion Native App** (React Native) specifically for the practitioner.

## 5. Strategic Roadmap

We will move from "Digital Filing Cabinet" to "AI Assistant".

### Phase 1: The Digital Cabinet (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Replace physical paper folders. Get clinics comfortable storing data with us. Digital trust building.

* **Feature: Enhanced Patient Profile**
  * Add a "Medical Records" tab.
  * **File Management:** Allow upload of PDFs, Images. (Manual upload by clinic staff).
  * **Simple Notes:** A clean, structured text editor for clinical notes (SOAP format: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan). Support templates.
* **Feature: Line "Drop Box"**
  * If a patient sends a photo to the Line Official Account, it automatically appears in a "Inbox" for that patient in our system. Staff can "File" it into the medical record with one click.
  * *Value:* Solves the "Fragmentation" problem immediately.

### Phase 2: The Structured Clinician (Months 4-6)

**Goal:** Streamline the workflow. Introduce semi-structured data.

* **Feature: Templating System**
  * Clinics create templates for common visits (e.g., "Initial Physio Assessment", "Flu Visit").
  * Templates mix checkboxes (structured data for analytics) and text areas.
* **Feature: Mobile "Photo Taker"**
  * Improve the Mobile Web experience. Doctor opens the patient profile on their phone, clicks "Add Photo", takes a pic of the injury, and it instantly syncs to the Desktop view where they are typing the note.
  * *Tech:* Efficient usage of WebSockets/Real-time sync.

### Phase 3: The AI Scribe (Months 7+)

**Goal:** The "Big Dream".

* **Feature: Audio Capture (Pilot)**
  * Start with **Desktop Recording** (easier technology). Doctor presses "Record" on their laptop while talking to the patient.
  * Implement "Companion App" (React Native) if mobile mobility is strictly required.
* **Feature: AI Synthesis**
  * Transcribe audio + parse Line chat history + look at uploaded photos.
  * Generate a **Draft** medical record in the chosen Template.
  * Propose **Follow-up Messages** (e.g., "AI noticed you recommended ice packs, draft a message to patient about icing techniques").

## 6. Immediate Next Steps (Action Plan)

1. **Design the Data Model:** Create Schema for `MedicalRecord`, `Attachment`, and `Template`.
   * Relationship: `Patient` 1 -- \* `MedicalRecord`
   * Relationship: `Appointment` 0/1 -- 1 `MedicalRecord` (Flexible linking).
2. **Prototype the "Files" Section:**
   * Add a simple drag-and-drop zone to the `PatientDetailPage`.
   * Connect S3/Cloud Storage.
3. **Customer Feedback Loop:**
   * Show the "Line Drop Box" concept to a friendly clinic. This is often a massive "Aha!" moment for them.
