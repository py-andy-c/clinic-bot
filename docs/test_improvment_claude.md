# Test Improvement Analysis

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Test Coverage:** 59% overall (916 of 2247 statements missed)  
**Test Results:** 199 passed, 1 skipped

## Executive Summary

While `run_tests.sh` passes with 199 tests, the 59% coverage and end-to-end testing failures indicate **critical gaps in integration testing**. The tests focus heavily on authentication flows but miss the core business logic: **LINE webhook processing, agent orchestration, appointment booking, and error handling**.

---

## Critical Missing Test Coverage

### 1. **LINE Webhook Integration (13% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/api/webhooks.py` (127 of 146 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- Only basic signature verification logic tested
- No actual webhook endpoint testing
- No integration with orchestrator

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ LINE webhook signature validation with real payloads
- ✗ Webhook processing with valid LINE message events
- ✗ Webhook error handling (invalid JSON, missing signature)
- ✗ Clinic identification from webhook headers
- ✗ Integration with `handle_line_message` orchestrator
- ✗ Google Calendar webhook processing
- ✗ Calendar event deletion detection
- ✗ Patient notification on therapist cancellation

**Why This Matters:**
This is the **primary entry point** for all patient interactions. Failures here mean the bot doesn't respond to users.

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
# tests/integration/test_line_webhook.py
async def test_line_webhook_with_valid_message(client, db_session):
    """Test LINE webhook processes text message and calls orchestrator."""
    
async def test_line_webhook_invalid_signature(client, db_session):
    """Test LINE webhook rejects invalid signatures."""
    
async def test_line_webhook_updates_clinic_stats(client, db_session):
    """Test webhook updates clinic webhook count and timestamp."""

async def test_gcal_webhook_detects_cancellation(client, db_session):
    """Test Google Calendar webhook detects deleted events."""
```

---

### 2. **Agent Orchestration (52% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/clinic_agents/orchestrator.py` (48 of 99 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- No tests for `handle_line_message` function
- No tests for agent routing logic
- No tests for conversation flow

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ Triage agent classification (appointment vs non-appointment)
- ✗ Account linking flow for unlinked users
- ✗ Appointment flow for linked users
- ✗ Guardrails integration (rate limiting, content safety)
- ✗ Session storage and conversation history
- ✗ Error handling in agent execution
- ✗ Agent result parsing and response formatting

**Why This Matters:**
This is the **brain** of the chatbot. It routes messages to the right agent and manages conversation state. Failures here mean incorrect responses or no responses.

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
# tests/integration/test_orchestrator.py
async def test_orchestrator_routes_appointment_query(db_session):
    """Test orchestrator routes appointment intent to appointment agent."""
    
async def test_orchestrator_handles_unlinked_user(db_session):
    """Test orchestrator prompts account linking for unlinked users."""
    
async def test_orchestrator_ignores_non_appointment_queries(db_session):
    """Test orchestrator returns None for chitchat."""
    
async def test_orchestrator_applies_rate_limiting(db_session):
    """Test orchestrator blocks users exceeding rate limits."""
```

---

### 3. **Agent Tools (11% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/clinic_agents/tools.py` (224 of 253 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- No tests for any agent tools
- Tools are the most critical business logic

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ `get_practitioner_availability` - slot calculation
- ✗ `create_appointment` - database + Google Calendar sync
- ✗ `cancel_appointment` - cancellation logic
- ✗ `reschedule_appointment` - rescheduling logic
- ✗ `verify_and_link_patient` - account linking
- ✗ `list_upcoming_appointments` - appointment queries
- ✗ Error handling for all tools (DB errors, API failures)
- ✗ Google Calendar sync failures and rollback

**Why This Matters:**
These tools perform the **actual business operations**. Bugs here mean appointments get double-booked, cancellations fail, or data corruption occurs.

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
# tests/unit/test_agent_tools.py
async def test_get_practitioner_availability_calculates_slots():
    """Test availability calculation excludes existing appointments."""
    
async def test_create_appointment_syncs_to_google_calendar():
    """Test appointment creation syncs to therapist's calendar."""
    
async def test_create_appointment_rolls_back_on_gcal_failure():
    """Test DB rollback when Google Calendar sync fails."""
    
async def test_verify_and_link_patient_detects_duplicates():
    """Test account linking rejects duplicate phone numbers."""
```

---

### 4. **Clinic API Endpoints (52% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/api/clinic.py` (91 of 190 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- Only basic member listing tested
- No appointment management tests
- No settings/configuration tests

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ Appointment listing and filtering
- ✗ Appointment type management (CRUD)
- ✗ Patient listing and search
- ✗ Clinic settings updates
- ✗ Google Calendar sync toggle
- ✗ Role-based access control for all endpoints
- ✗ Cross-clinic data isolation

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
# tests/integration/test_clinic_api.py
def test_list_appointments_filters_by_date_range(client, db_session):
    """Test appointment listing with date filters."""
    
def test_create_appointment_type_validates_duration(client, db_session):
    """Test appointment type creation validates duration."""
    
def test_clinic_user_cannot_access_other_clinic_data(client, db_session):
    """Test data isolation between clinics."""
```

---

### 5. **System Admin API (30% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/api/system.py` (128 of 183 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- Only clinic creation tested
- No monitoring/dashboard tests

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ System dashboard metrics calculation
- ✗ Clinic listing and filtering
- ✗ Signup link generation for clinics
- ✗ Billing and subscription management
- ✗ System-wide statistics

---

### 6. **Guardrails Service (46% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/services/guardrails_service.py` (40 of 74 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- No tests at all for this critical safety layer

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ Content safety filtering
- ✗ Rate limiting enforcement
- ✗ Conversation quality assessment
- ✗ Escalation detection
- ✗ Emergency keyword detection

**Why This Matters:**
This prevents abuse and ensures conversation quality. Missing tests mean potential security vulnerabilities.

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
# tests/unit/test_guardrails_service.py
def test_content_safety_blocks_inappropriate_content():
    """Test guardrails block violent/illegal content."""
    
def test_rate_limiting_blocks_excessive_requests():
    """Test rate limiting prevents spam."""
    
def test_emergency_keywords_logged_but_not_blocked():
    """Test emergency keywords are logged for monitoring."""
```

---

### 7. **Reminder Service (27% Coverage)**
**File:** `src/services/reminder_service.py` (61 of 84 lines missed)

**Current State:**
- No tests for reminder scheduling or sending

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ Reminder scheduling logic
- ✗ Reminder sending via LINE
- ✗ Reminder time calculation
- ✗ Batch reminder processing

---

## Test Architecture Issues

### 1. **Lack of End-to-End Tests**
**Problem:** Tests focus on individual components but don't test complete user flows.

**Missing E2E Scenarios:**
- ✗ New patient books first appointment (full flow)
- ✗ Existing patient reschedules appointment
- ✗ Therapist cancels via Google Calendar → patient notified
- ✗ Patient tries to book conflicting time slot
- ✗ Multiple patients booking same therapist simultaneously

**Recommended:**
```python
# tests/e2e/test_appointment_booking_flow.py
async def test_complete_new_patient_booking_flow():
    """
    Test complete flow:
    1. Patient sends message to LINE
    2. Bot prompts for phone number
    3. Patient provides info
    4. Account linked
    5. Patient requests appointment
    6. Bot shows available slots
    7. Patient selects slot
    8. Appointment created in DB and Google Calendar
    9. Confirmation sent via LINE
    """
```

### 2. **Insufficient Error Scenario Testing**
**Problem:** Tests focus on happy paths, missing error conditions.

**Missing Error Tests:**
- ✗ Database connection failures
- ✗ Google Calendar API rate limits
- ✗ LINE API failures
- ✗ Concurrent appointment booking conflicts
- ✗ Invalid date/time inputs
- ✗ Malformed webhook payloads
- ✗ Network timeouts

### 3. **No Load/Concurrency Testing**
**Problem:** No tests for concurrent operations.

**Missing Tests:**
- ✗ Multiple users booking same time slot
- ✗ Concurrent webhook processing
- ✗ Database transaction isolation
- ✗ Race conditions in appointment creation

### 4. **Mock Overuse in Integration Tests**
**Problem:** Heavy mocking in "integration" tests defeats the purpose.

**Example:** `test_auth_integration.py` mocks Google OAuth, httpx, and database operations, making it more of a unit test.

**Recommendation:**
- Use real database (SQLite in-memory for tests)
- Mock only external APIs (Google OAuth, LINE API)
- Test actual database transactions and constraints

---

## Specific Bug-Prone Areas

### 1. **Appointment Time Slot Conflicts**
**Risk:** Double-booking if availability check has race conditions.

**Missing Tests:**
```python
async def test_concurrent_appointment_booking_prevents_double_booking():
    """Test two users booking same slot results in one success, one failure."""
```

### 2. **Account Linking Edge Cases**
**Risk:** Duplicate phone numbers, orphaned LINE users.

**Missing Tests:**
```python
def test_account_linking_rejects_duplicate_phone_number():
    """Test linking fails if phone already linked to different LINE account."""
    
def test_account_linking_handles_existing_patient_record():
    """Test linking to existing patient record (not creating duplicate)."""
```

### 3. **Google Calendar Sync Failures**
**Risk:** Appointments in DB but not in calendar (or vice versa).

**Missing Tests:**
```python
async def test_appointment_creation_rolls_back_on_gcal_failure():
    """Test DB transaction rolls back if Google Calendar sync fails."""
    
async def test_appointment_cancellation_handles_gcal_already_deleted():
    """Test cancellation succeeds even if calendar event already gone."""
```

### 4. **Timezone Handling**
**Risk:** Appointment times stored/displayed in wrong timezone.

**Missing Tests:**
```python
def test_appointment_times_stored_in_utc():
    """Test all appointment times are UTC in database."""
    
def test_appointment_display_converts_to_local_time():
    """Test LINE messages show Taiwan local time."""
```

### 5. **LINE Webhook Signature Validation**
**Risk:** Security vulnerability if signature check can be bypassed.

**Missing Tests:**
```python
def test_line_webhook_rejects_missing_signature():
    """Test webhook returns 401 without signature."""
    
def test_line_webhook_rejects_tampered_payload():
    """Test webhook rejects payload that doesn't match signature."""
```

## Test Data and Fixtures

### Current State:
- Good: `conftest.py` provides `db_session` fixture
- Missing: Realistic test data factories

### Recommendations:

```python
# tests/factories.py
import factory
from models import Clinic, User, Patient, Appointment

class ClinicFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = Clinic
    
    name = "Test Clinic"
    line_channel_id = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"channel_{n}")
    # ... etc

class PatientFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = Patient
    
    full_name = factory.Faker('name', locale='zh_TW')
    phone_number = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"0912-{n:06d}")
    # ... etc
```

## Testing Best Practices to Adopt

### 1. **Test Naming Convention**
Use descriptive names that explain the scenario:
```python
# Bad
def test_appointment_1():

# Good
def test_create_appointment_prevents_double_booking_same_time_slot():
```

### 2. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**
```python
def test_example():
    # Arrange: Set up test data
    clinic = create_test_clinic()
    patient = create_test_patient(clinic)
    
    # Act: Perform the action
    result = book_appointment(patient, datetime.now())
    
    # Assert: Verify the outcome
    assert result.status == "confirmed"
    assert result.patient_id == patient.id
```

### 3. **Test One Thing Per Test**
Don't combine multiple assertions for different behaviors.

### 4. **Use Fixtures for Common Setup**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def clinic_with_therapist(db_session):
    clinic = ClinicFactory.create()
    therapist = UserFactory.create(
        clinic=clinic,
        roles=["practitioner"]
    )
    db_session.add_all([clinic, therapist])
    db_session.commit()
    return clinic, therapist
```

### 5. **Test Database Transactions**
Ensure tests clean up properly:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def db_session():
    # Create session
    session = SessionLocal()
    
    yield session
    
    # Rollback any uncommitted changes
    session.rollback()
    session.close()
```

---

## Metrics to Track

### Current Metrics:
- **Overall Coverage:** 59%
- **Tests Passing:** 199/200 (99.5%)
- **E2E Success Rate:** Unknown (failing in manual testing)

### Target Metrics:
- **Overall Coverage:** 80%+ (industry standard)
- **Critical Path Coverage:** 95%+ (webhooks, orchestrator, tools)
- **E2E Success Rate:** 100%
- **Test Execution Time:** <30 seconds (fast feedback)

### Coverage by Priority:
1. **Must be 90%+:**
   - `webhooks.py`
   - `orchestrator.py`
   - `tools.py`
   - `helpers.py` (account linking)

2. **Should be 80%+:**
   - `clinic.py` (API endpoints)
   - `guardrails_service.py`
   - `google_calendar_service.py`

3. **Can be 60%+:**
   - `system.py` (admin features)
   - `reminder_service.py`

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why are E2E tests failing but unit tests passing?

1. **Integration Gaps:** Unit tests mock dependencies, hiding integration issues.
2. **Missing Orchestrator Tests:** No tests for the main message handling flow.
3. **No Webhook Tests:** The entry point isn't tested end-to-end.
4. **Mock Overuse:** Tests don't exercise real database transactions.
5. **No Agent Execution Tests:** Agent tools are never actually called in tests.

### Example Failure Scenario:
```
User sends LINE message
  ↓
LINE webhook receives it (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Orchestrator routes to triage agent (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Triage classifies as appointment (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Orchestrator routes to appointment agent (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Agent calls get_practitioner_availability tool (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Tool queries database and calculates slots (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Agent formats response (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Orchestrator returns response (NOT TESTED)
  ↓
Webhook sends LINE message (NOT TESTED)
```

**Result:** The entire critical path is untested, so bugs slip through.

---

## Recommended Tools

### 1. **pytest-asyncio**
Already in use. Good for async tests.

### 2. **pytest-cov**
Already in use. Continue using for coverage reports.

### 3. **factory_boy**
For creating realistic test data:
```bash
pip install factory-boy
```

### 4. **pytest-mock**
For better mocking:
```bash
pip install pytest-mock
```

### 5. **freezegun**
For testing time-dependent logic:
```bash
pip install freezegun
```

### 6. **responses** or **httpx-mock**
For mocking HTTP requests:
```bash
pip install httpx-mock
```

---

## Conclusion

The test suite has **good coverage of authentication flows** but **critical gaps in business logic**. The 59% coverage masks the fact that the **core chatbot functionality is largely untested**:

- ✗ LINE webhook processing
- ✗ Agent orchestration
- ✗ Appointment booking tools
- ✗ Google Calendar sync
- ✗ Error handling
- ✗ End-to-end flows

**Immediate Action Items:**
1. Add integration tests for LINE webhook → orchestrator → agents flow
2. Add unit tests for all agent tools (especially appointment creation)
3. Add E2E tests for complete user journeys
4. Test error scenarios and edge cases
5. Reduce mocking in integration tests to catch real integration bugs

**Expected Outcome:**
With proper test coverage of the critical path, E2E testing failures should be caught by automated tests before manual testing.
