# Chinese Font for PDF Export

This directory should contain `NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttf` for Chinese text support in PDF exports.

## Manual Download Instructions

If the font file is missing or invalid, please download it manually:

1. Visit: https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk/releases
2. Download the latest release (e.g., `NotoSansCJK-VF.ttf` or look for Traditional Chinese subset)
3. Or use: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+TC
4. Extract and place `NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttf` (or similar) in this directory

Alternatively, you can use any TTF font file that supports Traditional Chinese characters.

The application will automatically fall back to image-based rendering for Chinese text if the font file is not available.
